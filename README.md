ESP8266 native Non-OS SDK 7-segment JSON number display

This is the necessary documentation for someone to collect the necessary components and compile the right code for
their very own web JSON reader.  Its pretty basic with a hardcoded wifi and website to access for the JSON. 

The components should all work well together, using the CATIA files, EAGLE files, and list of components to create
the device.  If you end up trying to build one, let me know!!!!!

The code does require a successfully installed pfaclon esp-open-sdk installation.  The makefile should work pretty straight-forwardly on a Ubuntu or Linux distro (thats what I used).

You can go over to my personal website for a more in-depth explanation of the design process with photos.
